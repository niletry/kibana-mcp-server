#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python is
#   bundled with the package.

#   According to pypa/pipenv#1191, it is recommended to not commit Pipfile.lock if it is a library.
#   For an application, you should commit it.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, it is generally recommended to not commit poetry.lock for a library.
#   Poetry doesn't yet have a way to ignore the lock file, so we have to ignore it ourselves.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipenv, it is generally recommended to not commit pdm.lock for a library.
